# voice-assistant-project
   This enhanced version of the voice assistant includes the following new features:
Setting reminders:
Use "set reminder" to add a new reminder.
Use "check reminders" to list all current reminders.
Playing music:
Use "play music" to play a random song from a specified directory.
Use "stop music" to stop the current song.
Controlling smart home devices (simulated):
Control lights: "Turn on/off living room/bedroom light"
Adjust thermostat: "Increase/decrease thermostat"
Lock/unlock door: "Lock/unlock front door"
To use these new features:
Replace "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.
Replace "path/to/your/music/directory" with the path to your music files.
Install the required additional libraries:
pip install pygame
This code provides a foundation for a more advanced voice assistant. You can further expand its capabilities by adding more smart home devices, integrating with actual IoT devices, implementing a proper reminder system with notifications, or adding more sophisticated music playback controls.
